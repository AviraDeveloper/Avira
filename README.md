## Protect your identity, banking information, and privacy
​Cybercriminals want your credit card details, passwords, and other personal information – and use malicious software like rootkits, keyloggers, and spyware to get them.

With Avira’s award-winning virus protection, hackers don’t stand a chance. Plus, you get a variety of privacy and performance tools, such as a free VPN, password manager, ad-blocker, software updater, and more.

Key features:

Free VPN for truly private and anonymous browsing. Secure your web traffic with end-to-end encryption and enjoy complete online freedom.
